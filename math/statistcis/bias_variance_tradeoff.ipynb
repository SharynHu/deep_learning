Model with high variance pays a lot of attention to training data and does not generalize on the data which it hasn’t seen before. As a result, such models perform very well on training data but has high error rates on test data.\n"

    "It's only possible to calculate the true variance if you have a set of every possible randomly-drawn data set $𝐷$ (or an equivalent p.d.f) and every single $𝑥$ input possible (or an equivalent p.d.f). This is the result of the mathematical definition of the variance of a learning model/algorithm: $𝐸_𝑥[𝐸_𝐷[𝑔^𝑑(𝑥)−\\overline{g}(𝑥)]]$, where $𝑑\\in𝐷$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will obviously never happen. The only time when you can exactly calculate the variance is when you create your own data. Even then, both $𝐷$ and $𝑥$ will likely be infinite (if you have any continuous predictors or outputs), so you'll just be approximating the variance by drawing large samples from $𝐷$ and $𝑥$.\n",

    "This statistical technique consists in generating samples of size B (called bootstrap samples) from an initial dataset of size N by randomly **drawing with replacement** B observations (there may contain duplicates in each subset).\n",

    "Under certain circumstances, bootstrap samples can be considered as representative and independent samples of the true data distribution (almost i.i.d. samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "This requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the size N of the initial dataset should be large enough to capture most of the complexity of the underlying distribution so that sampling from the dataset is a good approximation of sampling from the real distribution (representativity).\n",
    "2. the size N of the dataset should be large enough compared to the size B of the bootstrap samples so that samples are not too much correlated (independence).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approximate model variance via bootstrap\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use bootstrapping to generate several bootstrap samples that can be considered as being “almost-representative” and “almost-independent” (almost i.i.d. samples). These bootstrap samples will allow us to approximate the variance of the estimator, by evaluating its value for each of them.\n",
